                    I'm glad you chose to stop by today. I hope you do not feel it too bold of me to suggest that we dispense with pleasentries and get right down to business. I am a web designer. I assume that you are desirous of my skillset. Let us beat around the bush no longer. Let me tell you what I'm about...

                    <em>"Keep it Simple, Stupid."</em>  This phrase was said to be coined by a navy officer decades ago. But the priciple has been true for as long as problems existed. When looking for an answer to a problem,  not many people go looking for the prettiest or most complicated solution. It's usually the simple solution that wins. <br/><br/> Simple, functional web design aims to solve problems without complicating them. This usually means that it is the fastest solution as well.
