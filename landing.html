        <h1>Get Their Attention!</h1>
            <p>
                You have to get the attention of your visitors. And you
                only have about 3 seconds to do that.

                Your goal should be to have your visitors make a decision
                within the first 3 seconds of visiting your site. This can
                mean that you give them a physical choice to make, or you have them
                make a subconscious choice to stay on your page.

                The latter is the eaisier of the two.
